What is runish?
===============

A Unicode name finder and characters explainer.

Simple to use:

    $ runish umbrella
    ☂  UMBRELLA
    ☔ UMBRELLA WITH RAIN DROPS
    ⛱  UMBRELLA ON GROUND

    $ runish ☂
    UMBRELLA

In that simple use case it tries to guess what are you asking for. You can be explicit passing ``-e/--explain`` or ``-f/--find`` to select the behaviour mode.

ToDo:
    - implement explain
    - implement find
    - release
