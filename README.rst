What is runish?

A Unicode name finder and characters explainer.

Simple to use:

$ runish umbrella
FIXME

$ runish â˜‚
FIXME

In that simple use case it tries to guess what are you asking for. You can be explicit passing ``-e/--explain`` or ``-f/--find`` to select the behaviour mode.

ToDo:
- fix this README
- implement explain
- implement find
- release
